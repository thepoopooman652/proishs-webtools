# lib

Description
-----------
This folder contains reusable libraries and helper scripts used across the project. It may include PHP helper functions, small APIs, and third-party libraries.

Key files / subfolders
----------------------
- `php/` — PHP helper utilities and API scripts (for example `APIs/file-api.php`).
- `js/` — JavaScript libraries used in the tools.

Usage
-----
This folder is consumed by the various webtools in the project. Review individual subfolders for specific instructions.

Testing
-------
Run unit tests (if any). Manually inspect and run helper scripts through the webtools that use them.

Notes
-----
- I can produce a more detailed README that lists every file under `lib/` and documents what each does if you want.
